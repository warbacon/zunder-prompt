# zunder-prompt

Simple and fast zsh prompt based on [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus).

## Why? ü§î

I found myself oscillating between **Starship** and **Powerlevel10k** for my preferred
zsh prompt. Starship is very customizable and attractive by default,
but it has too many features that I don't use and that makes it slower than
I would like. Powerlevel10k on the other hand is extremely fast but the
configuration file is extremely complex.

My goal then was to create a prompt with the **basic functionality needed**.
After mulling this over, I came to the conclusion that simply seeing if
the previous command had failed and the information from the git repository
I was in was enough.

I also decided to **dispense with too many advanced customization options**,
as that would complicate the code and would not be necessary
if it was already pretty enough by default.

Zunder-prompt is inspired by Starship for its look and feel and uses
gitstatus to display git information. Normally the latter should slow down
the prompt quite a bit, however, this project is the same one that Powerlevel10k
uses for it and is extremely optimized, so the prompt has **no lag**
at all and **works instantly**.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Manual

1. Clone this repository wherever you want.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-prompt.git
    ```

2. Source `zunder-prompt.zsh` in your `.zshrc`.

    ```sh
    source /wherever/you/cloned/this/repo/zunder-prompt.zsh
    ```

### Zinit

```sh
zinit compile'./gitstatus/(install|*.zsh)' for \
    Warbacon/zunder-prompt
```

### Another plugin manager

I have not checked if it works with other plugin managers, but there **should not
be any problem** as long as you follow the usual procedure to install
a plugin in that plugin manager.

I will try to check if it works in the most common ones and give instructions
if necessary in the future. **Feel free to report to me any errors you find.**

## Customization üé®

As zunder-prompt is built with simplicity and speed in mind, there isn't too
much customization available. However, you can change the prompt's character
symbol.

```sh
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR="‚ûú"              # default value: "‚ùØ"
```
