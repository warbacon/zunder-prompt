# ‚ö° zunder-prompt

Simple and fast zsh prompt based on [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus).

## Why? ü§î

I oscillated between **Starship** and **Powerlevel10k** for my zsh prompt.
**Starship** is customizable and visually appealing by default but has
unnecessary features, making it slower. **Powerlevel10k** is extremely fast but
has a complex configuration.

My goal was to create a prompt with only the **essential functionality**:
detecting command failures and displaying basic git repository info. I avoided
advanced customization to keep the code simple yet aesthetically pleasing.

**Zunder-prompt** combines Starship's style and Powerlevel10k's efficiency. It
uses **gitstatus** (like Powerlevel10k) for optimized git info, ensuring
**instant responsiveness** with no lag.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

## Customization üé®

As zunder-prompt is built with simplicity and speed in mind, there isn't too
much customization available. However, you can change the prompt's character
symbol and color.

```sh
ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR="‚ûú"              # default value: "‚ùØ"

ZUNDER_PROMPT_CHAR_COLOR="green"    # default value: "fg"
```
